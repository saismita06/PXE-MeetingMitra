## Interactive Audio Synchronization

Experience seamless bidirectional synchronization between your audio and transcript. Click any part of the transcript to jump directly to that moment in the audio, or watch as the system automatically highlights the currently spoken text as the audio plays. Enable auto-scroll follow mode to keep the active segment centered in view, creating an effortless reading experience for even the longest recordings.

!!! tip "Transform Your Recordings with Custom Tag Prompts"
    Tags aren't just for organization - they transform content. Create a "Recipe" tag to convert cooking narration into formatted recipes. Use "Study Notes" tags to turn lecture recordings into organized outlines. Stack tags like "Client Meeting" + "Legal Review" for combined analysis. Learn more in the [Custom Prompts guide](admin-guide/prompts.md#creative-tag-prompt-use-cases).

## Latest Updates

!!! info "Version 0.9.3-alpha - Security patch (FFmpeg CVE-2026-8461)"
    A security patch. No configuration or data changes; pull the new image to upgrade.

    - **Patches CVE-2026-8461 ("PixelSmash")** - PXE MeetingMitra runs FFmpeg/ffprobe on uploaded media. The previously bundled FFmpeg (johnvansickle static 7.0.2) carried a heap out-of-bounds write in the MagicYUV decoder that a crafted file could use for a crash or remote code execution. Fixed upstream in FFmpeg 8.1.2.
    - **New FFmpeg source** - Because the johnvansickle static builds have been frozen at 7.0.2 since 2024, the image now sources FFmpeg from the maintained BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds project, pinned to the 8.1 release branch. This also resolves the intermittent build failures from the johnvansickle download.

    Recommended for all deployments, especially any that accept uploads from untrusted users. See the [full release notes](https://github.com/murtaza-nasir/speakr/blob/master/release_notes_v0.9.3.md).

!!! info "Version 0.9.2-alpha - Local / S3 storage backend"
    Recording audio can now be stored in S3-compatible object storage instead of, or alongside, the local filesystem. Backwards compatible; `FILE_STORAGE_BACKEND` defaults to `local`, so existing deployments are unaffected.

    - **Pluggable backend** - Set `FILE_STORAGE_BACKEND=local` (default) or `s3`. The S3 path works with AWS S3, MinIO, Backblaze B2, Cloudflare R2, and Wasabi.
    - **Presigned delivery** - In S3 mode, audio is served to the browser via short-lived presigned URLs straight from the object store rather than streamed through the app.
    - **Migration tooling** - `scripts/migrate_local_recordings_to_s3.py` moves existing recordings into a bucket with a dry-run mode, size verification, and optional source deletion.
    - **Configuration** - See the [File Storage](admin-guide/storage.md) admin guide for the full settings reference and per-provider examples, and the [Migration Guide](admin-guide/migration-guide.md#migrating-audio-files-to-s3) for moving historical files.

    Contributed by @Daabramov (#268). See the [full release notes](https://github.com/murtaza-nasir/speakr/blob/master/release_notes_v0.9.2.md) for details.

!!! info "Version 0.9.1-alpha - Upload-path fixes"
    A patch release hardening the v0.9.0 upload path. Backwards compatible with v0.8.x and v0.9.0; database migrations run automatically.

    - **CSRF token expiry on upload (#310)** - The upload path uses `XMLHttpRequest`, which bypassed the fetch-based CSRF refresh, so uploads failed with HTTP 400 once the page token crossed the one-hour limit. It now refreshes the token before sending and retries once on a CSRF rejection.
    - **Inquire embeddings with auto-summarization (#305)** - Semantic-search chunks were only built in the non-summary path, so with auto-summarization enabled new recordings were never embedded. Summary completion now runs the same chunking step. Pre-existing recordings need a one-time "Re-embed all".
    - **API token modals (#308)** - An unclosed `<div>` nested the Create Token modal inside the hidden folder modal; the markup is fixed so it opens again.
    - **Stalled-upload timeout & leave-page warning** - A size-scaled `XMLHttpRequest` timeout routes a stalled upload into the recovery path instead of hanging, and the browser now warns before you leave the page with an upload still in flight.

    See the [full release notes](https://github.com/murtaza-nasir/speakr/blob/master/release_notes_v0.9.1.md) for the complete list.

!!! info "Version 0.9.0-alpha - Multi-platform recording, Stats tab, mobile rebuild, design-system unification"
    The first non-patch release in the v0.8 line. Three big user-facing themes: capturing audio is now multi-platform, the mobile app is a first-class member of the design system, and the upload modal stops feeling like a desktop card pasted onto a phone. Backwards compatible with v0.8.x; database migrations run automatically.

    - **System Audio & Multi-Input Recording** - Platform detection with a per-OS help guide (macOS BlackHole + Multi-Output Device, Windows "Share system audio", Linux pavucontrol + `pactl module-virtual-source`). New Input devices picker mixes a primary mic plus an optional secondary device via Web Audio into one track, with a toggle to disable Chrome's echo cancellation / noise suppression / auto-gain and virtual-audio-device discovery.
    - **Stats Tab** - New per-recording tab: total length, speaker count, turns, and words as headline cards; per-speaker time / % / turns / words / WPM breakdown; silence row. Available on desktop and mobile.
    - **Upload Modal Redesign** - Real modal overlay (not a full-screen takeover), progressive disclosure of Options behind a chip summary, inline file preview with duration probe, sticky-footer Upload action, last-used tag / folder / language auto-restore, and a mobile bottom-sheet with drag-to-dismiss.
    - **Mobile UI Rebuild** - 56 px bottom navigation, contextual icons in the chevron row, edge-to-edge content, sticky speaker pills, sticky editor Cancel / Save footer, and audio-player polish.
    - **PWA Web Share Target** - Pick PXE MeetingMitra from your phone's native share sheet to send a recording straight in.
    - **Webhooks** - HMAC-SHA256-signed outbound notifications on recording lifecycle events, with SSRF guard and exponential-backoff retries, managed per-user from Account settings → Webhooks.
    - **Server-side recording sessions** - Long recordings stream chunks to the server during capture; the size cap is replaced by a configurable hours-based ceiling with resume-on-reload.
    - **Design-system unification** - 22 modals on shared `.modal-*` primitives, `.btn` + `.field` everywhere, dark-mode `<select>` theming, header consolidation, sidebar redesign, floating dockable chat panel.
    - **Inquire mode** - "+ New Recording" opens the upload modal directly via `?upload=1`. Also: `GET /api/v1/users/me`, an audio-player position preference, and a localization refresh across all seven languages.

    See the [full release notes](https://github.com/murtaza-nasir/speakr/blob/master/release_notes_v0.9.0.md) for the complete list.

!!! info "Version 0.8.21-alpha - Security: CSRF bypass and SSO account takeover"
    Security patch release on top of v0.8.20-alpha. Tracked as a GitHub Security Advisory; reported by **@Irench1k**.

    - Fixed a CSRF bypass where the `csrf_exempt_for_api_tokens` before_request hook permanently disabled CSRF protection on the targeted view as soon as any request carried a `?token=` query parameter (CWE-287). The hook is gone; CSRF skipping is now a per-request decision driven by `load_user_from_token_headers_only()`.
    - `change_password` no longer silently sets a password on an SSO-only account, closing the chained account-takeover path.

!!! note "Earlier releases"
    The full version history (the rest of the v0.8.x line and the v0.5 to v0.7 releases) is on the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/murtaza-nasir/speakr/releases).
