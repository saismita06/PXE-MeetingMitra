"""
Speaker Snippets Service.

This service handles the extraction and management of representative speech snippets
from recordings. Snippets provide context when viewing speaker profiles and help
users verify speaker identifications.

Key functions:
- Extract snippets when speakers are identified in recordings
- Retrieve snippets for display in speaker profiles
- Clean up old snippets to prevent database bloat
